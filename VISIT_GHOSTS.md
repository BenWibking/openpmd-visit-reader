# Supporting VisIt Ghost Synthesis

## Required Auxiliary Data

VisIt can synthesize ghost zones for structured or AMR meshes when a database
plugin delivers all three of the following:

1. **Structured domain boundaries** – an `avtStructuredDomainBoundaries`
   object populated with logical indices and AMR levels for each patch.
2. **Global node IDs** – deterministic IDs for every mesh node in a patch,
   returned as a `vtkIdTypeArray` named `avtGlobalNodeId` when the engine asks
   for `GLOBAL_NODE_IDS` / `AUXILIARY_DATA_GLOBAL_NODE_IDS`.
3. **Global zone IDs** – equivalent IDs for every cell, returned as
   `avtGlobalZoneId` in response to `GLOBAL_ZONE_IDS` queries.

Without this information VisIt assumes there are no overlapping zones between
patches, so the `InverseGhostZone` operator strips all data. The
`avtGhostZoneAndFacelistFilter` also demands both global-ID arrays before it
will trust domain adjacency.

## Implementation Steps

- Cache an `avtStructuredDomainBoundaries` per mesh—usually while populating
  metadata—via
  `cache->CacheVoidRef(meshName, AUXILIARY_DATA_DOMAIN_BOUNDARY_INFORMATION, timestep, -1, vr)`.
  Also store it under the `any_mesh` key; VisIt never asks for `domain == -1`
  later and simply pulls whatever the plugin tucked away in the cache. This
  matches what the built-in AMR readers (SAMRAI, FLASH, BATL, Chombo, etc.) do.
- Build deterministic global IDs by flattening logical indices into a single
  `vtkIdType`. For a cell patch the formula is
  `gi + Nx * (gj + Ny * gk)` where `gi/gj/gk` are logical coordinates and
  `Nx/Ny` are the mesh-wide dimensions along x/y. Node-centered meshes skip the
  extra `+1` on the upper bound; zone-centered meshes add it. Returning freshly
  allocated arrays works, but caching them in VisIt’s `VoidRefCache` (as the
  SAMRAI reader does) avoids recomputation and ensures the lifetime matches
  VisIt’s expectations. Each AMR level shares this same global logical index
  space. Patch `logicalLower/logicalUpper` values are already expressed on the
  finest grid, so finer levels simply produce higher index ranges; the limiting
  factor is the 32-bit logical-extent ceiling VisIt imposes for structured
  meshes.
- Continue advertising `AVT_HAS_GHOSTS` in mesh metadata, but do **not** try to
  fabricate `avtGhostZones` arrays yourself. Once VisIt accepts the structured
  boundaries and global IDs it marks overlap regions as ghosts, allowing
  operators like `InverseGhostZone` to work.

## Debugging Tips

- Run VisIt with `-debug 5` to capture `*.vlog` logs in the repo root. Look for
  `[openpmd-api-plugin] Global node ids ready...` to confirm the plugin served
  the arrays, and for `Rejecting domain boundaries...` messages if VisIt still
  distrusts the structured object.
- The rejection warning also prints the point count VisIt expected versus what
  the dataset actually has. If they differ, double-check the extents passed to
  `SetIndicesForAMRPatch`; they must be inclusive-exclusive (lower, upper+1).
- When things work, the logs show
  `avtGenericDatabase::GetDomainBoundaryInformation: Global for local success`
  with no subsequent rejection, and the `InverseGhostZone` operator stops
  discarding the entire mesh.
